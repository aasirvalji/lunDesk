## About

Having moved to online learning, i've noticed i've been getting distracted much easier than before. A prime contributor to this is Youtube. There's always a super enticing video that pops up on the side of my screen while im watching an unlisted video lecture for school or scavenging Youtube for videos to help me understand a topic im still fuzzy on.

## What makes lunDesk different?

- You can check how long your productive youtube sessions last by enabling 'watch mode' in the control panel.

- You can add multiple videos before starting your session. There's no need to constantly go back to Youtube to add videos to your watch list.

- More coming soon...

## Notes about this repository

- This was a super quick tool I built for personal use. However, I made this public in the hopes that it helps someone else ðŸ™‚

- There will only be minor updates/bug fixes (if they arise) to the platform.

## Run it locally

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run start` to start the development server

## Feedback

Feel free to reach out to me on any of my [socials](https://www.aasirvalji.com) if you have a cool feature you'd like added to lunDesk or want something to be fixed.
